            <p>The training workshop aims at developing the computer programming
                skills of those working on Earth Observation, including the members of the <a
                    href="https://www.aircentre.org/eo-lab/">Earth Observation Laboratory
                    (EO Lab)</a> and other laboratories.</p>
            <p>To stimulate collaboration beyond the training, the workshop is in
                person (full week). However, due to the high level of interest, remote participation is also possible.
            </p>
            <p>The topics covered include acquisition, processing, visualisation,
                and classification of Earth Observation data, using the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia
                    programming
                    language</a>.</p>
            <p>The training workshop will emphasize practical activities including
                the use of datasets, libraries/packages, automated workflows,
                Artificial Intelligence (AI), and classification algorithms.
                Theory-oriented sessions will introduce the concepts and hands-on
                activities.</p>

            <p>The open-source Julia language is relatively recent. It was created
                at the <a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology (MIT)</a>, first released in 2012, and reached the v1.0
                milestone in 2018. Julia has a vocation for high-performance scientific
                computing, making it today’s ideal choice to work on resource-intensive
                datasets such as the Earth Observation ones.</p>
            <p>Mutual benefits expected to arise from the collaboration of the AIR
                Centre and the Julia community include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capacity building for AIR Centre’s staff and other invited
                    institutions.</li>
                <li>Create collaboration opportunities between the participants and
                    speakers.</li>
                <li>Create the potential to extend the Portuguese contribution to the
                    scientific community.</li>
                <li>Bringing together the two communities around Julia: developers and
                    end-users.</li>
                <li>Opening new avenues for collaboration on both software and
                    science.</li>
                <li>Contributing to strengthening the open source / science
                    community.</li>
                <li>Creating an axis of collaboration to study the Azores region using
                    Earth Observation, numerical models, and data products.</li>
                <li>Finding new prospective contributors to Julia packages; helping
                    developers build up their user community; identifying needs and desired
                    new features.</li>
                <li>Providing additional exposure for the products and activity of the
                    AIR Centre; via US and EU growing Julia communities.</li>

            <p>The workshop will encompass different levels of expertise, from
                beginner to advanced, with a focus on Earth Observation concepts and
                programming skills. Our idea is to provide a single track of sessions in
                the morning and more detailed parallel sessions in the afternoon and to
                split people evenly on the double track part. There are three types of
                activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Plenary sessions (45’)</b> - Cross-disciplinary training
                        focused on theory and high-level concepts. These include the
                        presentation of novel EO datasets i.e. satellite data, ocean models, and
                        model products; processing &amp; visualization techniques as well as
                        available tools and packages. The first goal is to learn about new
                        datasets and sources, libraries, packages, techniques, and
                        implementation details. A secondary aim of this module is to identify
                        gaps in the EO domain and opportunities to close those gaps using the
                        Julia programming language.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Hands-on sessions (1h55’)</b> - The modules will focus on
                        concrete goals in data acquisition, processing &amp; visualization
                        techniques for example. They are designed to bridge between concepts and
                        real-life application through extended tutorials. Attendees will get an
                        introduction, through these tutorials, to performing common geospatial
                        tasks using Julia geospatial tools and common geospatial libraries and
                        packages.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>General hackathons (1h)</b> - Session that brings together
                        Julia developers to enhance
                        collaboration on EO applications and software development. The goal is
                        to organize the last module of the day in the common room and enable
                        everyone to work on intermediate &amp; advanced level aspects according
                        to their specific interests.</p>

            <img src="img/Eigil_Lippert.jpg" alt="Eigil Lippert" style="height:150px;">
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.d. in Numerical Glaciology in which I am
                working with a reconstruction of the Greenland ice sheet and its
                glaciers, going back to the last little ice age. This work is mostly
                centered around finite element modeling of glaciers and trying to
                understand their main drivers and dynamics.</p>
            <p>Before this, I did a master’s degree in engineering, focused on earth
                observation data, large-scale physics, and machine learning. I was
                involved in satellite observation and analysis and developed a method
                for synthesizing landslides in the InSAR coherence domain and building
                an algorithm that could detect these signatures in real-world SAR
                Coherence data. I also developed an InSAR coherence processor in Julia
                which could process SLC data and create interferograms and coherence
                estimates. I am currently in the process of porting this work into an
                open-source library, together with 3 other people.</p>

            <h2>Frank Muller-Karger</h2>
            <img src="img/Frank-Muller-Karger.jpg" alt="Frank Muller-Karger" style="height:150px;">
            <p>Frank Muller-Karger is a biological oceanographer (Professor) at the College of Marine Science,
                University of South Florida. Muller-Karger conducts research on how marine ecosystems change in time. He
                uses
                time series of observations collected by traditional oceanographic methods and by satellite sensors to
                study changes in water quality, primary production, and biodiversity in coastal and marine environments.
                This research helps in understanding how large-scale phenomena, like climate change or other
                disturbances, affect ecosystems including people.<br />
                The focus of his present work is to assess the
                importance of continental margins, including areas of upwelling, river discharge, and coral reefs in the
                global carbon budget. Muller-Karger combines the observations from different satellites to measure ocean
                color, sea surface temperature, winds, salinity and sea surface elevation and how these change. He uses
                field-based time series to measure the vertical structure of plankton and how particles settle in the
                ocean. Much of this work focuses on improving methods to measure the diversity of phytoplankton using
                remote sensing.<br />
                Muller-Karger has worked hand-in-hand with K-12 teachers and students and the public to showcase these
                new technologies and to highlight the importance of the ocean in our daily lives. He has a keen interest
                in linking science and education, and in addressing the problem of under-representation of minorities in
                scientific research programs. Muller-Karger was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the
                U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2001. In 2005, he was appointed to the Ocean Studies Board of the
                National Research Council/National Academies. He previously received the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                Award for Outstanding Contributions and the NASA Administrator Award for Exceptional Contribution and
                Service for supporting development of satellite technologies for ocean observation. From August
                2007-August 2009 he served as Dean of the School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST) at the
                University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He has B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in marine science and a
                Masters degree in management, and has authored or co-authored over 120 scientific publications.

            <p>Nathanael is a 4th Year PhD Candidate at Harvard University studying
                Tropical Climate Dynamics using a range of tools, from satellite
                observations and reanalysis datasets, to climate models that range from
                idealized small-domains, to global models. For the past three years, he
                has used Julia to aid in the retrieval and analysis of various climate
                observational datasets, and in the future aims to use Julia to help
                speed up the analysis of climate model output. Currently, he works under
                Professor Kuang to understand the differences in precipitation and
                moisture dynamics over tropical islands from both oceanic and
                continental regions.</p>

            <h2>Simon Danisch</h2>
            <p>Simon is the author of <a href="makie.org">Makie</a> and currently
                works full time on Makie as a freelancer. He has been part of the Julia
                community for more than 10 years and is the author of many Julia
                packages. To just name a few that are still actively used by many people
                in the Julia community: Makie, GeometryBasics, GPUArrays,
                PackageCompiler, JSServe and FileIO.</p>
            <p>His mission has always been, to create a sustainable plotting and
                graphics ecosystem for Julia, which enables visualizations in need of
                high performance as well as making it very easy to quickly create simple
                plots and integrate them into dashboards.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, with Climate change threatening to destroy the fundament of
                our modern life, he is focusing his efforts on making sure that Makie
                works well for climate science to better understand the changes that are
                coming for us.</p>

            <p>Junior Remote Sensing Scientist at EUMETSAT working in the
                scatterometry team. I support the quality monitoring, calibration and
                validation of operational scatterometer products and also prototype and
                maintain processing software for the extraction of products.</p>
            <p>I am a MSc graduate in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering from
                DTU and I have hands-on experience working with SAR data from my
                studies. Most of my academic projects focused on processing SAR images
                e.g. speckle filtering, interferometric coherence and automated flood
                mapping. I have implemented InSAR coherence processing in Julia
                (programming language) without using commercial software or SAR related
                libraries.</p>
            <p>I have also worked as an IT-consultant at Netcompany for 2 years
                where I was involved with support, maintenance and development of
                medium-sized public IT projects. My regular tasks included; defining and
                estimating tasks, developing new features, fixing existing bugs and
                providing general support.</p>
