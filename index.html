      <p>The training workshop aims at developing the computer programming
        skills of those working on Earth Observation, including the members of the <a
          href="https://www.aircentre.org/eo-lab/">Earth Observation Laboratory
          (EO Lab)</a> and other laboratories.</p>
      <p>To stimulate collaboration beyond the training, the workshop is in
        person (full week). However, due to the high level of interest, remote participation is also possible.</p>
      <p>The topics covered include acquisition, processing, visualisation,
        and classification of Earth Observation data, using the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia programming
          language</a>.</p>
      <p>The training workshop will emphasize practical activities including
        the use of datasets, libraries/packages, automated workflows,
        Artificial Intelligence (AI), and classification algorithms.
        Theory-oriented sessions will introduce the concepts and hands-on
        activities.</p>

      Background
    </summary>
    <p>
      </div>
    <div id="background" class="section level2">
      <p>The open-source Julia language is relatively recent. It was created
        at the <a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT)</a>, first released in 2012, and reached the v1.0
        milestone in 2018. Julia has a vocation for high-performance scientific
        computing, making it today’s ideal choice to work on resource-intensive
        datasets such as the Earth Observation ones.</p>
      <p>Mutual benefits expected to arise from the collaboration of the AIR
        Centre and the Julia community include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Capacity building for AIR Centre’s staff and other invited
          institutions.</li>
        <li>Create collaboration opportunities between the participants and
          speakers.</li>
        <li>Create the potential to extend the Portuguese contribution to the
          scientific community.</li>
        <li>Bringing together the two communities around Julia: developers and
          end-users.</li>
        <li>Opening new avenues for collaboration on both software and
          science.</li>
        <li>Contributing to strengthening the open source / science
          community.</li>
        <li>Creating an axis of collaboration to study the Azores region using
          Earth Observation, numerical models, and data products.</li>
        <li>Finding new prospective contributors to Julia packages; helping
          developers build up their user community; identifying needs and desired
          new features.</li>
        <li>Providing additional exposure for the products and activity of the
          AIR Centre; via US and EU growing Julia communities.</li>

      Program
    </summary>
    <p>
      </div>
    <div id="program" class="section level2">
      <p>The workshop will encompass different levels of expertise, from
        beginner to advanced, with a focus on Earth Observation concepts and
        programming skills. Our idea is to provide a single track of sessions in
        the morning and more detailed parallel sessions in the afternoon and to
        split people evenly on the double track part. There are three types of
        activities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Plenary sessions (45’)</b> - Cross-disciplinary training
            focused on theory and high-level concepts. These include the
            presentation of novel EO datasets i.e. satellite data, ocean models, and
            model products; processing &amp; visualization techniques as well as
            available tools and packages. The first goal is to learn about new
            datasets and sources, libraries, packages, techniques, and
            implementation details. A secondary aim of this module is to identify
            gaps in the EO domain and opportunities to close those gaps using the
            Julia programming language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Hands-on sessions (1h55’)</b> - The modules will focus on
            concrete goals in data acquisition, processing &amp; visualization
            techniques for example. They are designed to bridge between concepts and
            real-life application through extended tutorials. Attendees will get an
            introduction, through these tutorials, to performing common geospatial
            tasks using Julia geospatial tools and common geospatial libraries and
            packages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>General hackathons (1h)</b> - Session that brings together
            Julia developers to enhance
            collaboration on EO applications and software development. The goal is
            to organize the last module of the day in the common room and enable
            everyone to work on intermediate &amp; advanced level aspects according
            to their specific interests.</p>

      <h2>Eigil Yuichi Hyldgaard Lippert</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.d. in Numerical Glaciology in which I am
        working with a reconstruction of the Greenland ice sheet and its
        glaciers, going back to the last little ice age. This work is mostly
        centered around finite element modeling of glaciers and trying to
        understand their main drivers and dynamics.</p>
      <p>Before this, I did a master’s degree in engineering, focused on earth
        observation data, large-scale physics, and machine learning. I was
        involved in satellite observation and analysis and developed a method
        for synthesizing landslides in the InSAR coherence domain and building
        an algorithm that could detect these signatures in real-world SAR
        Coherence data. I also developed an InSAR coherence processor in Julia
        which could process SLC data and create interferograms and coherence
        estimates. I am currently in the process of porting this work into an
        open-source library, together with 3 other people.</p>

      <h2>Maarten Pronk</h2>
      <p>Maarten Pronk is a researcher at Deltares and an external PhD
        candidate at the Delft University of Technology. He holds a MSc in
        Geomatics and a BSc in Architecture, both from the Delft University of
        Technology (NL). His research concerns elevation modelling, especially
        in lowlands prone to coastal flooding. He aims to combine his interests
        in remote sensing and software engineering for societal impact. He
        promotes open and reproducible research and is the author of several
        open-source software packages for handling geospatial data, written in
        the Julia programming language. His work often involves handling
        trillions of elevation measurements, requiring a careful selection and
        design of both spatial storage formats and processing algorithms.
        Currently he works on applying data from ICESat-2, a LiDAR satellite, on
        global elevation models.</p>
