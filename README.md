**Date**: 9-13 January 2023   
**Place**: [Science and Technology Park](https://terinovazores.pt/), on [Terceira Island](https://exploreterceira.com), in the [Azores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores).     
**Type**: In-person, full-week, technical and networking.  
**Accommodation**: Speakers will be hosted in [Hotel do Caracol](https://www.hoteldocaracol.com)**** in Angra do Hero√≠smo, Terceira Island. 
 

*The AIR Centre provides a shuttle for each workshop day in the morning and afternoon. The evening networking event will be held in the Historic Centre of the Town of [Angra do Hero√≠smo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angra_do_Hero%C3%ADsmo) ‚Äã‚Äãinscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.*

## Introduction  

The following training workshop aims at providing quality computer programming skills to the staff members of the AIR Centre's [Earth Observation Laboratory (EO Lab)](https://www.aircentre.org/eo-lab/) located on Terceira Island, in the Azores. The EO Lab is only three years old, and much of its staff is at the beginning of their career, while others are transitioning from older programming languages/methods/paradigms. The shift from graphical user interface GUI-based work to computer coding (programming) is fundamental to support both *replicable research* and the upscaling of solutions to *prototypes* and *proofs-of-concept*, which better permeate the economy.

To simulate collaboration beyond the training, the workshop is presential (full week). However, for a wider reach, we aim to deliver several sessions online.

The topics to be covered include acquisition, processing, visualisation, and classification of Earth Observation data, using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

The open-source Julia language is relatively recent. It was created at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu), first released in 2012, and reached the v1.0 milestone in 2018. Julia has a vocation for high-performance scientific computing, making it today's ideal choice to work on resource-intensive datasets such as the Earth Observation ones.

The training workshop will emphasize practical activities including the use of novel datasets, libraries/packages, automated workflows, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and classification algorithms. Theory-oriented sessions will introduce the concepts and hands-on activities.

Beyond the direct advantages of the staff training, the concentration of talent in one event responds to a long-term vision of the EO Lab to embed itself and its staff members into "lower-level" scientific networks, creating new opportunities for collaboration and contributing to shaping the agenda.

Mutual benefits arising from the collaboration of the AIR Centre and the Julia community are:

* Capacity building for AIR Centre's staff and other invited institutions. 
* Create collaboration opportunities between the participants and speakers.
* Create the potential to extend the Portuguese contribution to the scientific community.
* Bringing together the two communities around Julia: developers and end-users.
* Opening new avenues for collaboration on both software and science.
* Contributing to strengthening the open source / science community.
* Creating an axis of collaboration to study the Azores region using Earth Observation, numerical models, and data products, possibly with the goal of co-advising students.
* Finding new prospective contributors to Julia packages; helping developers build up their user community; identifying needs and desired new features.
* Providing additional exposure for the products and activity of the AIR Centre; via US and EU growing Julia communities.



## Program   

The workshop will encompass different levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced, with a focus on Earth Observation concepts and programming skills. Our idea is to provide a single track of sessions in the morning and more detailed parallel sessions in the afternoon and to split people evenly on the double track part. There are three types of activities:

* **Plenary sessions (45‚Äô)** - Cross-disciplinary training focused on theory and high-level concepts. These include the presentation of novel EO datasets i.e. satellite data, ocean models, and model products; processing & visualization techniques as well as available tools and packages. The first goal is to learn about new datasets and sources, libraries, packages, techniques, and implementation details. A secondary aim of this module is to identify gaps in the EO domain and opportunities to close those gaps using the Julia programming language. 

* **Hands-on sessions (1h55‚Äô)** - The modules will focus on concrete goals in data acquisition, processing & visualization techniques for example. They are designed to bridge between concepts and real-life application through extended tutorials. Attendees will get an introduction, through these tutorials, to performing common geospatial tasks using Julia geospatial tools and common geospatial libraries and packages.
 
* **General hackathons (1h)** - Session that brings together Julia developers and AIR Centre EO Lab staff in order to enhance collaboration on EO applications and software development. The goal is to organize the last module of the day in the common room and enable everyone to work on intermediate & advanced level aspects according to their specific interests.

## Eigil Yuichi Hyldgaard Lippert

I am currently pursuing a Ph.d. in Numerical Glaciology in which I am working with a reconstruction of the Greenland ice sheet and its glaciers, going back to the last little ice age. This work is mostly centered around finite element modeling of glaciers and trying to understand their main drivers and dynamics. 

Before this, I did a master's degree in engineering, focused on earth observation data, large-scale physics, and machine learning. I was involved in satellite observation and analysis and developed a method for synthesizing landslides in the InSAR coherence domain and building an algorithm that could detect these signatures in real-world SAR Coherence data. I also developed an InSAR coherence processor in Julia which could process SLC data and create interferograms and coherence estimates. I am currently in the process of porting this work into an open-source library, together with 3 other people.
