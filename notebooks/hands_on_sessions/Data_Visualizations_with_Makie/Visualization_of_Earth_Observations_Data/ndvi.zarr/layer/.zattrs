It is in the local UTM projection (as used by Sentinel 2). The data has been aggregated to 9 time steps per meteorological season, i.e. it is approximately 10-daily. Variables from ERA5 and SMAP thus come in 3 variants each, the mean, the mininimum (min) and the maximum (max) since the last time step.
